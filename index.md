## _Abstract_

## Introduction : Put some vizualizations : pie charts, map, word could... to expose the issue of racism

Alton Sterling, Stephon Clark, or more recently Breonna Taylor and Georges Floyd have tragically become symbols of the struggle against police violence. The US police is indeed often involved in a lot of cases of racial persecution towards minorities, and in reaction, there have been many protests to try to change this constant harassment. According to the Washington Post [1], 918 persons have been shot and killed by police in the past year. By doing a short analysis between 2015 and today with their database and normalizing each killed race by the number of the US inhabitant of the same race, it shows that black Americans are killed by police more than twice as high as the rate for white Americans.
On the right, taking into account only those who are not armed (even not a knife) for questions of legitimacy,  unarmed black people are 3 times more likely to be killed by US police than white people.
The interpretation of these results shows that there is indeed a form of harassment and injustice since black people are much more subject to being shot than white people. 


Armed and unarmed                                                         |  Unarmed

# Idea of plan

## Global analysis on all the years

### Introducing our dataframe : who are our speakers ?
### Sentiment analysis

Plotting the distribution among gender, age or party for particular sentiment scores.

Regression analysis to see also the influence of the different features on the sentiment score. 

### Topic detection --> introducing the big names
### Peak detection, matching with the big names
### Showing the impact of mediatized and 'famous' death on the occurences of quotations using the relative increase and the Pearson correlation

We expect a negative correlation between the number of quotations and the number of days elapsed since the last unlegitimate fatal police shooting. Indeed, the closer to the event, the more quotations we expect. (Pearson's correlation)

We also expect that ther would be more quotations after than before such an event. (Relative increase in the number of quotations)

Make vizualizations on the impact : who reacts the most to the deaths ?
